Notes:
Evo-Pearl
based on Evo-Lisa

some say genetic algorithm
some say hill climbing algorithm

Paper-JS:
Very similar to Photoshop and Illustrator
Work with layers, objects, rasters, hues, saturation
Language is similar (new layer, place layer, rotate, translate, skew, shear)

Virtual DOM
 - can make changes to elements without displaying it on the canvas, which probably saves on rendering


Pros:
but a lot of the object oriented methods that you use when you program genetic algorithms like this are way easier because of Paper's DOM and Object-oriented style.

Cons:
Probably still not as performant as working on HTML canvas directly.


Parting thoughts:

Genetic algorithms are not a good way to paint a picture.

Reeeally computationally expensive, my CPU was going nuts

each generation creates a new Chromosome object (which holds the layer that holds the drawing), a lot of object creation

Was also not a great way to harness the power of Paper.js, which makes the creation of animation and responsiveness really easy, but is not for really high-powered image processing.
