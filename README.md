# Evo-Pearl

A project in implementing a genetic algorithm in Javascript & Paper.js that draws Vermeer's "Girl with the Pearl Earring" using polygons. Inspired by Roger Alsing's "Evo-Lisa".

Each new generation modifies polygons and runs a pixel-by-pixel comparison between the rasterized vector drawing and the source.
